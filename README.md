# data-for-water-level-forecasting-30-northern-lakes
This repository deposits data relevant to the paper "Evaluating Long-Term Forecasting Performance Decay and Seasonal Effects in Deep Learning-Based Water Level Forecasting Models Across Multiple Northern Lakes" 
## Meteological and water level observations (folder meteo_and_WL_data)
The water level observations, from the Finnish Environment Institute (Syke) Open data, are used as part of input (historical water level), output label, and water dynamics analysis.

Extracted meteological input data files are too big to upload. However, you could find the original netcdf files used for data extraction from open data services of the Finnish IT center for science, https://paituli.csc.fi and Finnish Meteological Institute, https://www.ilmastokatsaus.fi/2022/07/06/daily-gridded-evapotranspiration-data-for-finland-for-19812020/
## Performance metrics of the forecasting models (folder performance_metrics)
NSE, RE, RMSE scores for each lake from lead time = 1 to lead time = 30
