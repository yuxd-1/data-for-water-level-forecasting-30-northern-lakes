Extracted meteological input data files are too big to upload. However, you could find the original netcdf files used for data extraction from open data services of the Finnish IT center for science, https://paituli.csc.fi and Finnish Meteological Institute, https://www.ilmastokatsaus.fi/2022/07/06/daily-gridded-evapotranspiration-data-for-finland-for-19812020/
